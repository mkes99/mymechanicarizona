Transmission service, repair and rebuilding are different ways of dealing with transmission problems in your vehicle. Transmission service is a routine maintenance that involves changing the fluid and filter, and inspecting the transmission for any signs of wear or damage. Transmission repair is a more specific procedure that involves replacing or fixing a faulty part on the surface of the transmission, such as a solenoid or a sensor. Transmission rebuilding is a more extensive and costly process that involves taking apart the transmission and replacing all of the worn-out parts with new or refurbished ones. Transmission replacement is the most drastic option that involves swapping out the entire transmission unit for a new or used one. The best option for your vehicle depends on the type and severity of the problem, the age and condition of your transmission, and your budget and preferences.
