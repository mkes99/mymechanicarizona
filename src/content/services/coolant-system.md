Your vehicles coolant systems consist of a radiator and other components. A radiator is a device that helps cool your engine by circulating coolant through the engine block and releasing heat through the radiator fins. If your radiator is damaged or leaking, it can cause your engine to overheat and lead to serious problems.

##### Some common signs of coolant system problems are:

*   High temperature gauge reading on your dashboard
*   Coolant leak under your car or on the radiator itself
*   Low coolant level in the reservoir or radiator cap
*   Discolored or rusty coolant that indicates corrosion or contamination
*   Steam or smoke coming from under the hood

##### Some things to do to prevent coolant system issues are:

*   Check your coolant level regularly and top it off if needed
*   Use the right type of coolant for your car and mix it with water according to the manufacturer’s instructions
*   Flush your cooling system every two years or 30,000 miles to remove dirt and debris
*   Inspect your radiator for cracks, leaks, or bent fins and fix them as soon as possible
*   Avoid driving with an overheated engine and pull over if you see the temperature gauge rising

If you notice any of these signs, you should take your car to a professional technician for a coolant system inspection and repair. Depending on the severity of the damage, you may need to replace the radiator or some of its components, such as hoses, clamps, fans, or thermostat. Bring your vehicle in and have one of our experienced technicians inspect your coolant system.
