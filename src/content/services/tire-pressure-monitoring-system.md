title: "Tire Pressure Monitoring System"
---

Nowadays, all modern vehicles are equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS). Each tire has sensors in it that sends the tire’s pressure to a central computer. When the pressure is too high or too low, a warning light illuminates on your dashboard, that indicates this pressure has to be corrected.

The tire pressure monitoring system not only prevents premature tire wear but it also makes your car more fuel efficient and provides a smooth driving experience. As a matter of fact, for every 3 pounds of pressure lost, you lose 1% of your fuel economy. Moreover, the TPMS provides assistance in preventing flats, overheating, and even tire blowouts.

Apart from the occasional replacement of the sensors, tire pressure monitoring systems need very little maintenance. Sometimes, if you change your tires between seasons, there’s a good chance that you’ll break a sensor. That’s why it’s best to leave that job to a certified technician. Additionally, when new sensors are installed on a set of spare tires or a sensor is replaced, the technician at our auto repair shop can synchronize the tire pressure monitoring system with the central computer.
