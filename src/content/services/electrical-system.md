From the battery and lights, to the starter and alternator, the electrical system of modern cars is quite complex. It continuously monitors electrical circuits to ensure every component is operating within the range intended. Any faults or variances outside the operating parameters could be logged by the system and illuminate a warning light. This light will display to advise you that something is not operating correctly. If that happens to you, you should immediately consult a technician, since electrical services are very specific and can be performed only by professionals.
