It’s one of the many reasons why we should give the needed credit to our exhaust system, and not think of it only when it makes a sound. The exhaust system is part of a bigger picture that also involves your emission control system. Both the exhaust and the emission control system work closely together in order to regulate the harmful gases and pollutants that are emitted from your vehicle and control your cars noise at the same time.\n\nWhen you have an efficient exhaust system, you create a healthier environment and make your vehicle quieter while driving down the road. Each one of us has heard a moving vehicle that is in need of an urgent muffler repair service. This particular sound cannot be mistaken. There are two types of mufflers – the first one uses a sound absorbing material and the second one is a baffled chambered muffler.\n\nIf your car is having muffler or exhaust system problems, our trained technicians at our auto repair shop can assist you in making a decision about what type of service would be best for you. The maintenance of your exhaust system can be an easy task, if you stay on top of your vehicle’s general preventative services.\n\nPay a visit to our auto repair shop and let our technicians take care of your exhaust system.

For all your transmission flush needs, visit our qualified and experienced transmission experts.\n\n### Radiator Flush\n\nA car’s radiator has the important task of keeping the engine cool. Radiator repair and maintenance is essential to the health of your engine and your vehicle. A good heating and cooling system service entails flushing the old antifreeze from your radiator and filling it with new antifreeze. For a quality radiator flush, trust our qualified mechanics.\n\n### Coolant System Flush\n\nA coolant flush and fill is basic maintenance for your cooling system and will help ensure maximum performance from your car’s heating and cooling systems. New antifreeze will help your car’s engine run cooler, and flushing it will remove any dirt, rust or sediment which may damage the water pump and clog the engine water jacket and radiator. Bring your vehicle to our experienced technicians for a professional coolant system flush!\n\n### Brake System Flush\n\nWhen you step on the brake pedal, hydraulic fluid rushes to each brake to apply the pressure that slows your vehicle. Over time the fluid can become compromised by moisture and other contaminants and brake performance can suffer. Water can accumulate in the fluid which affects braking efficiency, increases the corrosion of brake system components and can be the cause of total brake failure. To prevent this, bring your vehicle to our expert mechanics for a professional brake system flush!\n\n### Differential Flush\n\nWorn-out differential fluid can lead to unreliable differential performance, noise, excessive wear, breakdown, or failure. Complete differential failure will result in your entire differential system needing to be replaced. That is why you need a timely differential flush – leave your vehicle in the competent hands of our qualified and experienced mechanics and enjoy safety on the road!\n\n### Power Steering Flush\n\nPower steering fluid lubricates all of the moving parts throughout the power steering system. It prevents parts from wearing out and failing by removing contaminants which accumulate in the old fluid, and conditions the o-rings and seals. However, when power steering fluid circulates throughout the system of the pump and gear, it picks up wear material, as well as contamination from the breakdown of aging hoses and seals – any fluid that churns and is under high pressure, will wear out in time and be contaminated.

It helps your vehicle drive smoother, your tires last longer, and ultimately keeps your wheels pointed in the right direction. Just like how your shoes can wear, so do your tires, and if your wheels are not properly aligned, they can wear unevenly.\n\nA wheel alignment service is very important because it can expand the life of your tires. Even the smallest alignment issue can result in an uneven tire wear. Once your wheels are properly aligned, it’s smooth cruising ahead, saving you tire wear, fuel, and ultimately…money.\n\n### Tire Installation\n\nIt’s very important to perform regular tire maintenance, not just for the safety of your family, but also to ensure a long lifespan for your vehicle. You are advised to always consult with your owner’s manual in terms of finding the proper tire size for the year, make and model of your vehicle. When you purchase new tires, they have to be in sets of 4, or at least in matching groups of 2 on each axle. This extends the life of your new tires and keeps your tire wear even.\n\nIf you need help with your tire purchase, some to us! We can help you compare tire specifications and prices before you buy, to ensure you are getting the best new tires for your needs and budget.\n\n### Tire Balancing\n\nTire Balancing is important to increase the basic safety of your vehicle and extend the life of your tires. The certified technicians at our auto repair shop are here to help with all of your tire balancing and tire service needs.\n\nTire balancing happens each time you replace your vehicle’s tires. Since tires wear depending on road problems and driving practices, uneven wear can be visible after the initial 1,000-2,000 miles of use. It’s important to check your tires balance every 4,000-6,000 miles. Our certified technicians can assist in determining if your tires need to be balanced and rotated based on mileage and wear.\n\n### Tire Rotation\n\nYour vehicle’s weight is not distributed evenly to all four corners. If you leave all 4 tires just the way they are, some tires would eventually wear out faster than others. We know that a tire rotation is an essential part of making your tires last longer. The tire rotation process consists of moving your tires from front to back, moving them from one side of your vehicle to the other or a combination of both.\n\nUneven tire wear could bring about unsatisfactory gas efficiency, poor performance, reduce the life of the new tire and can easily cause safety problems. Regular tire rotation helps eliminate premature tire wear and could save you a lot of money on new tires. Visit our auto repair shop and let our trained technicians rotate your tires.\n\n### Tire Inspection\n\nTires need to be checked on a regular basis for damage, such as stones, nails or other sharp objects that may have penetrated the tire. They also need to be checked for bulges, tears or cuts that might be the result of contact with road hazards. If you have doubts about the condition of your tires, it’s best to have them inspected by our technicians.
